Case study II employed Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 dataset obtained from Liu Lab [1]. 
The dataset was acquired using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer in an alternating fragmentation setting.
The resulting data comprised of two sets of spectra, each containing 2027 scans from collision-induced dissociation (CID) and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), respectively.
