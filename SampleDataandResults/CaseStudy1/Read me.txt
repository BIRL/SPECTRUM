The HeLa dataset, which was used in case study 1, was obtained from Kelleher Lab [1]. 
The dataset comprised of 10 MS spectra of Hela Histone H4 protein acquired using a Q-FTICR hybrid mass spectrometer.
The spectra were calibrated externally using an electron-capture dissociation (ECD) bovine ubiquitin spectrum.
